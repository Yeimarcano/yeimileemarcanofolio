        <h1>Yeimilee <br> Marcano</h1>  
         <p>Hola!
            I’m Yeimilee Marcano, an aspiring graphic designer. Well, I already consider myself a graphic designer. I just need my diploma in my hands, that actually in 4 months I will get it with the title “Associate in Science in Multimedia Programming and Design in the field Graphic Design. I know it sounds AMAZING!!! It won’t end there. Graphic Design is a big industry and I want to learn more and more, especially when this job is evolving every time. So I decided to pursue my bachelor degree in Visual Communications. 
            <br>
            What makes me a unique graphic designer is that I always trust my gut and think bigger. I always go for the difference, not the similarities. That’s why when people think that they have a clue of what I will come with, they always get a big surprise about my work. <br>
            That is my phrase. “Go beyond expectations.”
            <br>
            Perhaps my design skills go more than people expect, I always reach the main purpose of the project and I also address and clarify to the audience, making each of my projects creative and unique.
            <br>
            I always believe that a good graphic designer has to be good at every type of graphic design. However, we always are better in one kind. I’m still looking forward to what I’m best at. Meanwhile, I give you some knowledge of what I’m good at. 
            <br>
            Throughout my major, I’ve been working on Print Design, involving Posters, Book Covers, Newsletters, Infographics, and more. On Branding, creating a visual identity, including for my persona. On Ux Design, in which I made homepages and apps, and have knowledge of how users can interact with it  (UI), which is also very important at the time of design. As you can see right now, I also work with Web Design, creating webpages and working with responsive layout,using HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. I have to be honest with you, I’m still learning, but if you want a simple website, here I am. <br>
            About me as a person. I’m creative. YAYYY. <br>
            But also I’m enthusiastic, focused, and passionate. I enjoy learning something new every day and adapt quickly to new challenges. My dedication and determination drive me to give my best effort to achieve my goals. I speak two languages: I’m a native Spanish speaker; and after living 3 years in New York, an English speaker too. <br>
            I have always been interested in the art and design world, especially graphic design. I used it a lot in my high school presentations, homeworks, and even in my letters to Santa Claus when I was a kid. Perhaps at that time, I didn’t know that it was actually Graphic Design. But I always love to put so much effort into making it better with some images, or illustrations, or my choice of colors, the perfect font, that people can be actually attracted by it. Yes, I know Santa Claus couldn’t be attracted to my Christmas letter, but I know my parents did. That’s why I believe that becoming a Graphic Designer was my destiny. <br>
            Now, I’m here, showing you who I am, how I work, my work, my best work, and even more… HOW I CODE THIS WEBSITE, that it was stressful but here it is. Here I am. <br>
            Nice to meet you!!!
